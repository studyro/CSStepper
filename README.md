# Description

This is my private graduation project. CSStepper is a iPad application which will be used for C programming teaching. This app contains 20(or more) C snippets examples used in class.

# Overview

CSStepper mainly consists of two parts:

* String Handler for input snippets to be shown on the interface. `CSCodeParser`
* Interfaces' workflows for each example.

# PS

CSStepper is now ongoing.
